# a report on information theory concepts with source coding algorithm implementation

this is a brief survey of basic information theory concepts (information, entropy , source coding and channel coding).
I've also implemented a textual source coding (text compression) algorithm called the LZW (Lempel–Ziv–Welch) in matlab: [LZW.m](./LZW.m)
