# line follower robot using a FSM circuit

this is a small line follower robot made with off the shelf 74xx components as a course project for the (digital logic I) course, other interesting features are a smoothing PWM circuit to smooth the motor control signals, and additional logic to prevent decision conflicts due to multiple sensor inputs.
