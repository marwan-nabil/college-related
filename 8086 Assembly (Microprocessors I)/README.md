# Micropeocessors I assembly assignments
a couple of assignments i did for the course labs, they are a:
- reverse polish calculator (they required a normal calculator, but that would require some sort of grammar (CFG), a reverse polish only needs a stack (PDA)).
- a trivial encryption scheme that uses a hashtable of hard coded replacements.
