### Micropeocessors I assembly assignments
a couple of assignments i did for the course labs.   
### BER calculations in AWGN channels (digital communication)
Bit Errot Rate calculations in Additive White Gausian Noise channels (matlab program), i can't recall how it actually does that because matlab is so fucking ugly.  
### Line Follower Robot for Digital Logic I course
using only 74xx logic components, a toy car that follows black lines on white floors, stops at IR-enabled traffic lights and uses a smoothing control circuit. 
### GSM implementation in matlab *
only sampling and coding stages (viterbi-speech coding-interleaving),  i don't think the modulation/demodulation stages work, but i'd rather rewrite it than check it, because it's matlab.
### Text compression (information theory)
I implemented a textual source coding (text compression) algorithm called the LZW (Lempel–Ziv–Welch) in matlab.
### Linear transformations (Linear algebra)
a linear algebra course assignment, it takes a set of vertices in 2d space as inputs to form a polygon, then the user chooses multiple consecutive linear transformations to be done on that polygon, and the result is plotted at the end.- ### Micropeocessors I assembly assignments
### NS-3 assignments (Networks)
some simulations written for the NS-3 discrete events simulator, a simple udp client-server, and a walking wifi station with throughput and BER measurements.
### basic transformations (signals and systems)
A modular matlab program containing a set of experiments + a time domain signal generator module (time domain manual tracing), does basic time and frequency domain transformations and adds channel effects and analyzes them.
### openBTS poster (NRSC 2018)
draft of the openBTS poster i submitted to the National Radio Sciences Conference of 2018.
### simple unix shell
this is a programming assignment for the operating systems course, it focuses on using the fork() and execvp() system calls, it parses input arguments and detects the background directive (&) also.
### static ram interface
a small c program targeted at an 8052-based microcontroller, the program interfaces a static ram module with the controller and the controller to the serial port on a computer, writes a bunch of bytes to ram and checks them,  also included is a program that checks 74xx series logic gates and prints their exact part numbes to the serial connection (COM port) and checks if any gate is defunct.
