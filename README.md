- ### Micropeocessors I assembly assignments
a couple of assignments i did for the course labs.   
- ### BER calculations in AWGN channels (digital communication)
Bit Errot Rate calculations in Additive White Gausian Noise channels (matlab program), i can't recall how it actually does that because matlab is so fucking ugly.  
- ### Line Follower Robot for Digital Logic I course
using only 74xx logic components, a toy car that follows black lines on white floors, stops at IR-enabled traffic lights and uses a smoothing control circuit. 
- ### GSM implementation in matlab *
* only sampling and coding stages (viterbi-speech coding-interleaving),  i don't think the modulation/demodulation stages work, but i'd rather rewrite it than check it, because it's matlab.
- ### Text compression (information theory)
I implemented a textual source coding (text compression) algorithm called the LZW (Lempel–Ziv–Welch) in matlab.
- ### Linear transformations (Linear algebra)
a linear algebra course assignment, it takes a set of vertices in 2d space as inputs to form a polygon, then the user chooses multiple consecutive linear transformations to be done on that polygon, and the result is plotted at the end.- ### Micropeocessors I assembly assignments
- ### NS-3 assignments (Networks)
some simulations written for the NS-3 discrete events simulator, a simple udp client-server, and a walking wifi station with throughput and BER measurements.
- ### basic transformations (signals and systems)
A modular matlab program containing a set of experiments + a time domain signal generator module (time domain manual tracing), does basic time and frequency domain transformations and adds channel effects and analyzes them.
